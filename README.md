## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
- App1: Instagram
  Instagram Reels which are continuously scrollable providing short videos
  Deleting old messages without any trace notifying others
  
- App2: Spotify
  Dark and clear user interface
  Spotify Canvas feature which is a short looping visual users can see from each of the song tracks while streaming
  Personalized song recommendations and Discoverability feature
  
- App3: Lapse
  Providing users aesthetic experience with automatic analog filtered photos when they snap photos and develop it
  Photos only shared with selected friends, without all that other social baggage
  
  
Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

- Application Idea: Fitness application that mainly targets people who are new to work out which recommends detailed workout routine which includes guidelines for the proper form of each exercises and provide diet and nutrition information
